# Made By McGill



Today marks my last day at McGill University...  
2020 denotes my 10th year at McGill; in January 2011, I stepped onto the McGill campus as a young, naive PhD candidate. Today, as I prepare for a new adventure, I will inevitably miss McGill and everyone here.    

McGill has been a HUGE part of my life. I took graduate, undergraduate and continuing Ed. classes here. I learnt and I taught. I studied, I volunteered, and I worked. I started my marriage at McGill, I had my kids at McGill and I matured at McGill. I made some of my closest friends at McGill...  

I want to take this moment to thank the #neuro for the 3 great years I spent there.  

I want to thank Dr. Mathieu Blanchette and his lab for a great PhD experience.  

I want to thank Dr. Guillaume Bourque, Dr. Mathieu Bourgey and the C3G team for a great working experience and a wonderful 3 years.  

I want to thank the McGill community as a whole for being a home/family to me for the last 10 years!  
I will certainly miss everyone!
