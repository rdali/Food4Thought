      <description>Customizing Server Welcome Message I recently set up a home server as a small project to keep me sane during the COVID-19 social distancing period. I have been slowly customizing it to my liking to have a fully functional server that I can host files on and to learn a thing or two about Linux Sys Admin tasks.
I wanted to customize the text that gets printed out when you first log into a server.</description>

      <description>Setting Up a CentOS 7 home server 
I have been planning to set up a home server for a year now but have been putting it off. This week, with the COVID-19 lockdown, my husband and I pulled out the 3 ancient computers sitting in our garage to set up one decent home server.
