      <description>My Field of Study: Chromatin Architecture My research career has involved multiple different fields and countless questions. My area of expertise though is that which I worked on for the larger part of my PhD: Genomics. Specifically, my PhD thesis examined genetic aspects of the development of an aggressive brain cancer, Glioblastoma. Much of my PhD work remains to be published. It involves looking at DNA folding or chromatin architecture.</description>

      <title>Setting up GenPipes on Compute Canada Servers</title>

      <description>Objective In this practical, we will set up GenPipes, to be able to access its installed modules, pipelines and genomes.

Setting up GenPipes To set up GenPipes, you will need to add some lines of code in your bash_profile file on the server you will be using. The bash_profile is a hidden file in your home directory that sets up your environment every time you log in. Alternatively, you can also use your bashrc file.</description>
