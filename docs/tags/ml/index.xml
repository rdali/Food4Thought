      <description>Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) Summer School 2020 This year, I was 1 of the 300 participants selected from around the globe for the DLRL 2020.
This is a prestigious annual event organized by the 3 major machine learning reaseach institutes in Canada: MILA (Montreal), Vector (Toronto) and Amii (Alberta), all brought together through CIFAR.
Overall impression I was impressed by the number of women on the lecture panel and the number of women attending the event.</description>
