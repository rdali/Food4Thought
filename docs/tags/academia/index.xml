      <description>Research Science, Med School &amp;amp; Engineering I was always fascinated with Science. The Why and How intrigue me. As a child, I would sit and watch toy mechanisms to draw out how they function and would disassemble broken toys before discarding them to see what they contained. The research scientists with their white lab coats and pipettes were an image I often romanticized.
I knew at a very early age that I&amp;rsquo;d be a researcher, to the disappointment of my parents who like most other arab parents, prefered professions like Medicine or Engineering.</description>
