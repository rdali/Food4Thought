      <description>Setting Up a CentOS 7 home server 
I have been planning to set up a home server for a year now but have been putting it off. This week, with the COVID-19 lockdown, my husband and I pulled out the 3 ancient computers sitting in our garage to set up one decent home server. The purpose was mainly curiosity; to play with pieces of hardware and software to learn a few things and to have our own little server to test various pipelines.</description>

      <description>COVID-19: sense in a time of non-sense 
As I watch people around me panic, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d scribble down the words that I have been reciting to my husband three times a day for the last week.

      <description>Objective In this practical, we will set up GenPipes, to be able to access its installed modules, pipelines and genomes.

Setting up GenPipes To set up GenPipes, you will need to add some lines of code in your bash_profile file on the server you will be using. The bash_profile is a hidden file in your home directory that sets up your environment every time you log in. Alternatively, you can also use your bashrc file.</description>
